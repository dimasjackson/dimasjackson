# Dimas Jackson, M. S.
<p align="justify" >
Hello! I'm a Data Engineer at @Mackenzie and a PhD candidate at SÃ£o Paulo State University. I look for innovative solutions in data storage and processing such as the Semantic Web technologies (Knowledge Graphs, SPARQL, RDF, Wikibase). Simultaneously, I design workflows for Extracting, Transforming and Loading data (ETL) using PL/SQL (PostgreSQL and MSSQL Server), Python programming and the low-code KNIME Analytics tool. I also have experience with Machine Learning and Power BI interactive dashboards to transform data into insights!
