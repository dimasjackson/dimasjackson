# Dimas Jackson, M. S.

Hello! I'm a Data Engineer at @Mackenzie and a PhD student at SÃ£o Paulo State University. I look for innovative solutions in data processing such as the use of language models (such as chat GPT) in the business sphere and Semantic Web technologies (Knowledge Graphs, RDF , Wikibase).

Simultaneously, I have been working on an ecosystem of procedures and functions in PL/SQL for processing non-relational data coming from APIs and storing it in the relational database, combining the best features of both paradigms.

Additionally, I design workflows for extracting, transforming and loading data using PostgreSQL, Python programming and the low-code KNIME Analytics tool. I have experience with Machine Learning and Power BI interactive dashboards to transform data into insights!

## Professional Experience 
* Data Engineer - Mackenzie Presbyterian University

May 2023 - present (9 months) SÃ£o Paulo, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil
I develop an ecosystem for communicating applications (APIs) with the SQL database, in the AWS cloud (serverless). I contribute to improving data mining at the institution, designing and standardizing the process of storing, cataloging, extracting, transforming and loading data.

* Data Analyst - Freelance

January 2023 - May 2023 (5 months) SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil
I generated insights from raw data, developing complex extraction, processing and analysis for BI consultancies, retail and education companies. Developed statistical analysis, Machine Learning models and interactive dashboards.

* Doctoral Fellow - CAPES

March 2019 - May 2023 (4 years 3 months) SÃ£o Paulo-SP, Brazil
I analyzed data on Supernova distances and density parameters of the universe using Machine Learning and Python programming to solve complex problems in the Theory of General Relativity. I created data visualizations, developed Bayesian statistical inference, gave oral presentations of results and published scientific articles in high-impact international journals.
